### Agentic retrieval is ideal when you want a large language model (LLM) to intelligently decide whether to fetch additional context from a vector store or respond directly to the user.

### Workflow Steps
## Document Preparation:
# Fetch and preprocess documents that will serve as the knowledge base for retrieval.


## Indexing & Retriever Creation:
# Index these documents for semantic search and set up a retriever tool that enables efficient, context-aware querying.

## Agentic RAG System:
# Build an agentic RAG system where the agent autonomously determines when to leverage the retriever tool versus when to generate a direct response, optimizing for both relevance and efficiency.

# This approach enables more adaptive, contextually grounded, and user-centric LLM applications.
